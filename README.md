# 🌱 EcoRuta BAQ

**Environmental Platform** — Recycle your everyday waste and earn rewards.

EcoRuta BAQ is a web platform built as an Integrative Project (Proyecto Integrador) at **Riwi**, designed to promote responsible recycling in Barranquilla, Colombia. It combines environmental education, an interactive map of authorized collection points, a photo-verified delivery system, and an ecological points/rewards program to turn recycling into a rewarding daily habit.

Citizens often want to recycle but don't know *what* can be recycled, *how* to prepare it, or *where* to take it. EcoRuta BAQ closes that gap: users learn how to recycle each type of material, find nearby drop-off points on a map, register their deliveries with photo evidence, and earn ecological points once an administrator validates the report — points that can later be redeemed for rewards.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **JavaScript (Vanilla ES6+)** — core application logic, hash-based dynamic routing (`hashchange`), DOM manipulation, view injection and client-side session persistence.
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling for the responsive UI, dynamic visual states (e.g. Recycler/Administrator role selection cards) and visual consistency across the Dashboard and Landing Page.
- **Leaflet.js** — open-source interactive maps library, used to render OpenStreetMap tiles and plot geolocated recycling drop-off points across Barranquilla.
- **HTML5 (dynamic templates)** — UI structured through template literals, loaded dynamically based on the SPA's navigation state.

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express.js** — REST API exposing all business logic.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** — stateless authentication and role-based authorization (recycler vs. administrator).
- **Multer** — middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` uploads (delivery photo evidence).

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** — relational database storing users, spots, guide items and reports, with full referential integrity.
- **pgAdmin 4** — local database administration during development.
- **Supabase** — managed PostgreSQL used for cloud deployment (drop-in replacement, no code changes required).

### Tooling
- **GitHub** — version control and collaborative development (GitFlow).
- **Trello** — Scrum board for sprint planning, backlog and process evidence.
- **Figma** — UI/UX design and prototyping.

## 🏗 Architecture

EcoRuta BAQ follows a decoupled **client-server architecture**:

```
┌───────────────────────────┐        HTTPS / fetch        ┌───────────────────────────┐        SQL (pg)        ┌─────────────────────┐
│      CLIENT (Browser)     │        JSON + JWT            │      SERVER (Node.js)     │                         │     PERSISTENCE      │
│  Vanilla JS SPA (hash     │ ───────────────────────────▶ │  Express REST API         │ ──────────────────────▶│  PostgreSQL           │
│  router) + Tailwind CSS   │                               │  Middlewares: auth (JWT), │                         │  (Supabase / pgAdmin) │
│  + Leaflet.js (maps)      │ ◀─────────────────────────── │  admin, upload, errors    │ ◀───────────────────── │  + evidence uploads    │
└───────────┬───────────────┘                               │  Models: user, report,    │                         └─────────────────────┘
            │ tiles                                          │  spot, guide             │
            ▼                                                └───────────────────────────┘
     OpenStreetMap
```

A core architectural rule: **ecological points are always calculated on the server** (quantity × points-per-kg defined in `guide_items`) and are only added to a user's total once an **administrator validates** the corresponding report — the client can never manipulate its own score.

### Frontend (SPA)
The frontend is a Single Page Application. `router.js` drives navigation through the `hashchange` event, dynamically loading views from `src/pages/` (landing, login, register-page, dashboard, points-dashboard) without full page reloads.

- `components/` — reusable UI elements (`alert.js`, `button.js`, `input.js`, `navbar.js`).
- `pages/` — main application views, each as an independent module.
- `services/` — API communication layer (`api.js`, `authService.js`, `dashboardService.js`, `landingService.js`, `pointsService.js`), keeping network logic separate from presentation.
- `main.js` / `router.js` — application entry point and hash-based route control.

### Backend
The backend follows a modular MVC-style structure on top of Express:

- `config/db.js` — PostgreSQL connection pool configuration.
- `middleware/` — `auth.middleware.js` (JWT verification), `admin.middleware.js` (admin role guard), `upload.middleware.js` (Multer file uploads), `errorHandler.js` (centralized error handling).
- `models/` — `user.model.js`, `report.model.js`, `spot.model.js`, `guide.model.js`.
- `routes/` — `auth.routes.js`, `report.routes.js`, `spot.routes.js`, `guide.routes.js`, `points.routes.js`, `admin.routes.js`.
- `uploads/evidencias/` — storage for user-submitted evidence photos.

## 🗂 Data Model

Four core entities: **users**, **spots**, **guide_items** and **reports**, with `reports` acting as the central entity linking a user, a material and (optionally) a drop-off point.

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `users` | Registered accounts. `role` distinguishes *recycler* from *administrator*; `points_total` holds validated points. |
| `spots` | Authorized drop-off points in Barranquilla: name, address, zone, accepted materials and coordinates (used by Leaflet.js). |
| `guide_items` | Recycling guide: one row per material with preparation instructions and points awarded per kilogram. |
| `reports` | Each delivery: user, material, quantity (kg), evidence photo, status (`pending` / `approved` / `rejected`), calculated points, and the admin who validated it. |

**Relationships**
- `users (1) — (N) reports` — a user can register many deliveries.
- `guide_items (1) — (N) reports` — each delivery is classified under one guide material.
- `spots (1) — (N) reports` — a delivery can be linked to the drop-off point where it happened.
- `users (1, admin role) — (N) reports` — an admin can validate many reports (`validated_by`).

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- A running PostgreSQL instance (local, or Supabase — see below)

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `DATABASE_URL`:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/eco_ruta
```

### 3. Create the database and load the schema
```bash
createdb eco_ruta
psql -d eco_ruta -f ../database/eco_ruta.sql
```
This creates the tables (`users`, `spots`, `guide_items`, `reports`) and seeds:
- The 6 recycling guide materials with their points per kg.
- The 5 authorized drop-off points in Barranquilla.
- A test administrator account — **Email:** `admin@ecorutabaq.com` · **Password:** `Admin1234`

### 4. Run the server
```bash
npm run dev   # with auto-reload
# or
npm start
```
The server runs at `http://localhost:3000`. The Vite-powered frontend is already pointing to it.

### 5. Migrate to Supabase (managed PostgreSQL)
Supabase is plain PostgreSQL, so **no code changes are required**:
1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Go to *Project Settings → Database → Connection string → URI* and copy it.
3. Paste it into `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` and set `DATABASE_SSL=true`.
4. Run `database/eco_ruta.sql` once in Supabase's *SQL Editor*.
5. Restart the backend.

## 📝 User Stories & Epics

The backlog is organized into **6 epics** and **15 user stories**, tracked on Trello:

| Epic | User Stories |
|---|---|
| 🟣 EP-01 User Management | HU-01 Register · HU-02 Login · HU-03 Logout |
| 🟢 EP-02 Report Management | HU-04 Register delivery · HU-05 Upload evidence · HU-06 History |
| 🔵 EP-03 Recycling Points | HU-07 View recycling points · HU-08 Point information |
| 🟡 EP-04 Points System | HU-09 Calculate points · HU-10 View my points · HU-11 Ranking |
| 🔴 EP-05 Administration | HU-12 Pending reports · HU-13 Approve report · HU-14 Reject report · HU-15 Dashboard |
| 🟤 EP-06 Recycling Guide | Guide on how to recycle each type of material |

Core flow — *as a recycler, I register, learn how to recycle, deliver material with photo evidence, and earn points once an admin validates my report; as an admin, I review, approve/reject, and monitor platform metrics.*

## 📋 Methodology & Scrum Evidence

The project was developed using **Scrum**, managed through a Trello board organized by workflow columns: *Product Backlog*, *Sprint Backlog*, *In Develop*, *In revision*, *Testing QA*, *Finished* and *Bugs*, plus a dedicated *Information of the project* section holding the team's branch/commit conventions and a *Documentation* list tracking the project's deliverables (README, technical pitch, commercial pitch, technical document, test cases).

Each card includes a subtask checklist, member labels and, when applicable, due dates — giving full traceability of each user story's progress throughout the sprint.

---

## 🌿 GitFlow

Branch and commit conventions used across the team (led by Alejandro González):

**Branches**
- `main` — stable branch, only tested and delivery-ready versions.
- `develop` — integration branch where new features converge before reaching `main`.
- `feature/feature-name` — one branch per user story (e.g. `feature/registro-usuario`, `feature/dashboard-admin`).
- `fix/bug-name` — branches for bug fixes found during QA.

**Commit convention** (semantic prefixes)
- `feat:` new functionality
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` Tailwind/styling changes with no logic change
- `refactor:` internal code improvements with no behavior change
